# HSLU PREN Project 2018

The aim of this project is to build an autonomous robot that moves on a wire rope as quickly as possible, picks up a wooden cube and places it precisely in a moveable target field.
The hardware used contains a Freedom Board for the handling of the sensors and motors and a Raspberry Pi for programming the logic.
